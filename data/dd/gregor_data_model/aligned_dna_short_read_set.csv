aligned_dna_short_read_set_id,identifier for a set of experiments (primary key),string,,"RCs make their own IDs (these must begin with center-specific prefix). 
aligned_dna_short_read_set_id links the aligned_dna_short_read table to the called_variants_dna_short_read table. For centers that are only uploading single sample files, the aligned_short_read_set_id and aligned_short_read_id values can be identical. For centers uploading multi-sample files, they will need to come up with a value for aligned_short_read_set_id that makes sense to them for indicating the sample group for a multi-sample callset, and use that same value in called_variants_short_read."
aligned_dna_short_read_id,,string,,the identifier for a single-sample aligned_dna_short_read included in the read_set (one per row)
