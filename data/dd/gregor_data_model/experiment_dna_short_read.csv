variable_name,description,data_type,enumerations,notes
experiment_dna_short_read_id,identifier for experiment_short_read (primary key),string,,"RCs make their own IDs, must begin with center abbreviation as defined in participant table; need to be globally unique in consortium; may be generated by prepending experiment_sample_id with center abbreviation"
analyte_id,,string,,
experiment_sample_id,identifier used in the data file (e.g. VCF header / LIMS ID),string,,"may be the same as experiment_short_read_id if the file does contain sample identifiers
should be present if downstream file contains a sample_id (e.g. BAM, VCF)
some centers have one id for the sample (tube) and a diff ID for the sample as named in the VCF; experiment_sample_id = ID in the VCF file; analyte_id = ID for the tube/aliquot/whatever"
seq_library_prep_kit_method,Library prep kit used,string,,Can be missing if RC receives external data
read_length,"sequenced read length (bp); GREGoR RCs do paired end sequencing, so is the example of 100bp indicates 2x100bp.",int,,Can be missing if RC receives external data; all RCs are doing paired-end reads.
experiment_type,,string,targeted=targeted;genome=genome;exome=exome,facilitates having exome and GS-SR experiments in the same experiment_details table
targeted_regions_method,Which capture kit is used. Can be missing if RC receives external data,string,,
targeted_region_bed_file,name and path of bed file uploaded to workspace,string,,Can be missing if RC receives external data
date_data_generation,Date of data generation (First sequencing date),date,,Can be missing if RC receives external data; ISO 8601 date format
target_insert_size,insert size the protocol targets for DNA fragments,int,,Can be missing if RC receives external data
sequencing_platform,sequencing platform used for the experiment,string,,Can be missing if RC receives external data
